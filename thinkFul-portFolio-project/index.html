               <p>Other than technology, Design patterns and creativity seems interesting. I do Calisthenic workouts, and interested in playing soccer , cricket and basketball. I am a fan of WRC and X games. Collecting non-fiction books, good music ( guitar solos and drum sets ) and arts ( like Leonardo Da Vinci and the Wright brothers ). The cooking part, I try to eat clean as the foods are the medicine. </p>

             <p>While doing different jobs and I have been learning to code for a long time. Following through many tutorials and online sources like Codecademy, Teamtreehouse, freecodeCamp, Udemy, and coaches in Youtube with an Interactive frontend web development Book by John Duckett. I was determined but lost. And after Interacting with some coding boot camps, I joined thinkful and I am very happy to be a part of it.  </p>
